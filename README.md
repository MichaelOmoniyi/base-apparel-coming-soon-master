## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced the use of color gradient and box-shadow

```css
.customerInput img {
    background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 80%, 86%), hsl(0, 74%, 74%));
    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 80%, 86%), hsl(0, 74%, 74%));
    box-shadow: 0vw 1vw 90px hsl(0, 36%, 70%);
}
```


### Continued development

I'd love to master the use of viewport usage

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me regarding getting the right syntax for box-shadow and gradient.
